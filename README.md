# Streamlining Institution Application Processes with Innovative Tracking and Estimation System
# Smart India Hackathon 2020 Winning Project

- In collaboration with a team of 6 members, I have successfully developed a comprehensive solution to streamline the application process for an institution. Our solution includes an innovative application tracking system that enables users to monitor the progress of each application through every stage of the process.
- To ensure that the application process is smooth and efficient, we have incorporated an estimation feature that predicts the turnaround time of each application. In addition, we have implemented an alert system that sends notifications via email and SMS to avoid any delays in the process.
- The system also includes a powerful dashboard that allows administrators to monitor the performance of employees and departments, identify any bottlenecks in the application process, and track the progress of each application through a detailed timeline.
- Our application is developed using Python Flask Framework, which provides a robust and scalable platform for our solution. Additionally, we have developed an Android mobile application using Java, which enables users to track their applications on the go. To ensure data security and reliability, we have utilized MongoDB as our database system.
- Overall, our application is designed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the application process for institutions, resulting in a faster and more streamlined experience for both applicants and administrators.
